### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales and revenue performance of Maven Roasters, a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City over the first half of the last year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, patterns, make data driven decisions, and oppurtunities for the business.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Coffee Shop Sales.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale and revenue made by the shop.

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel

### Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Familiarizing with data and inspected data.
2. Added new columns to calculate revenue, month, day of week, hour, weekend/weekday.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

EDA involved exploring the sales data using pivot tables to answer the key questions, such as:

- What is the overall revenue trend by month?
- How many transactions are done by day of week and by hour of day?
- What are the peak sales period?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the Top 15 product types leading in transactions?
- which of the coffe shop location generated highest sales and orders?
- How many transactions are done by product category?
- which category plays the main role in revenue contribution?

### Data Vizualization through Dashboard

In the final data vizualization phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Added Pivot Charts say line chart, column chart, bar chart.
2. Added a slicer and connected to the pivot tables on the sheet.
3. Designed layout for dashboard.
4. Adjusted formatting, alignmentand polish to the dashboard.

### Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

#### Key Insights:

- **Consistent Revenue Growth:** Sales revenue has shown a stable uptrend since February, indicating a healthy business trajectory.
- **Golden Sales Hours:** The period between 8 am to 10 am emerges as the prime time for peak sales every day, signifying a bustling morning rush. However, sales tend to decline during the evening hours, particularly from 6 pm to 8 pm.
- **Peak Sales Time:** The busiest hour, 10 am, is especially prominent on Thursdays, Mondays, and Fridays, suggesting a pattern of heightened activity during weekdays.
- **Weekday vs. Weekend Dynamics:** Weekdays witness higher quantities sold, resulting in noticeable revenue spikes compared to weekends. This trend indicates that a significant portion of regular customers are likely office-goers.

#### Customer Preference Insights:

- **Coffee Dominance:** The coffee category leads in transactions, comprising 39.17% of total transactions across all three locations. Among coffee varieties, gourmet brewed coffee (11.34%) and Baristo espresso (11%) are favored by coffee enthusiasts.
- **Brewed Chai Tea:** Despite the tea category accounting for 30.48% of total transactions, brewed chai tea stands out as the most preferred drink among customers, representing 11.52% of total transactions.

#### Revenue Insights:

- **Coffee Reigns Supreme:** Coffee emerges as the leading revenue contributor at 38.63%, followed closely by tea at 28.11%, underscoring their significance in revenue generation.
- **Top Revenue Products:** Baristo espresso leads the pack, contributing 13.08% to total revenue, followed by brewed chai tea, which contributes 11.03%.
- **Minimal Contribution:** Packaged chocolates and flavors make minimal contributions to revenue, standing at 0.63% and 1.20% respectively, suggesting potential areas for improvement or adjustment.

#### Location Insights:

- **Hells Kitchen Dominance:** Hells Kitchen location boasts the highest sales and orders compared to the other locations, indicating its popularity and profitability.
- **Stable Transactions in Astoria:** Transactions in Astoria remain steady throughout the day, even during closing hours, reflecting a consistent customer base.
- **Fluctuations in Lower Manhattan:** Lower Manhattan experiences fluctuating transaction patterns, witnessing a sharp decline post 6 pm, highlighting potential opportunities for optimization during evening hours.

### Recommendations

Based on the following analysis, we recommend the following actions:
1. **Weekday Revenue Optimization:** Tailor promotions and events to weekdays to enhance revenue by 10%. Implement targeted weekday promotions, such as "Morning Rush Deals" or "Weekday Specials," to attract more customers during peak hours.
2. **Operational Adjustments in Lower Manhattan:** Adjust operational hours to close after 6 pm in Lower Manhattan, aligning with the observed decline in transactions during evening hours. This change aims to contribute to the targeted 15% reduction in operational inefficiencies.
3. **Evening Promotions:** Implement special offers or discounts in the evening to stimulate sales post-peak hours. Introduce "Evening Happy Hours" with discounted prices on select items to attract customers during traditionally slower periods. Aim for a 10% increase in sales during evening hours through these promotions.
4. **Category Prioritization:**
- **Direct focus towards the main revenue-contributing categories:**
  - Coffee: 39% - Increase focus on promoting premium coffee blends or introducing new specialty drinks. Aim for a 10% increase in coffee sales.
  - Tea: 28% - Enhance the tea menu with new varieties or flavors to attract tea enthusiasts. Target a 10% increase in tea sales.
  - Bakery items: 12% - Introduce fresh bakery specials or combo deals to boost bakery sales. Aim for a 10% increase in bakery item sales.
  - Drinking chocolate: 10% - Promote drinking chocolate as a comforting beverage option, especially during colder months. Target a 10% increase in drinking chocolate sales.
  - Coffee beans: 6% - Offer promotions on bulk coffee bean purchases or introduce loyalty programs for coffee bean customers. Aim for a 10% increase in coffee bean sales.
5. **Trimming Non-Performing Categories:** Consider eliminating packaged chocolates and flavors, which contribute only around 0.63% and 1.20% respectively, to streamline offerings and focus on high-impact products. This adjustment aims to optimize resources and focus on top-performing categories.
